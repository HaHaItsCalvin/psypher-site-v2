      quote:  There isn’t anything else like Psypher. We start where
              it matters - with the youth. The stages of growing up
              impact who we are, how we are, and what we become;
              therefore, being able to provide an insightful wellness
              education allows us to start those conversations at a
              young age. I’m blessed and grateful to be part of this
              team by spreading the word about what we do and the
              people we impact through the lens of a camera.

      quote:  My favorite part about working with Psypher
              is hearing the unique perspectives that youth
              bring to the table. It’s empowering to see
              these young people engaging in discussions
              about wellness and watching their growth
              over the course of our workshops. I also get
              to work with such an incredibly passionate,
              creative, and down-to-earth team to make it
              all happen!
