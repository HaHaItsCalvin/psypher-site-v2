          "It brings together something many people struggle with alone and 
          something that brings people together, so maybe the combination can help get

          alone with any mental health concerns they may be facing."

        "Sometimes there is stuff that you feel is burdening
        you, and it’s hard to put it into words. Sometimes
        releasing it through a physical medium, through
        your body, lets you release that without having to
        say anything. That’s a cathartic experience."

          when I was their age.”

        "My first experience with the program was fantastic.
        In the dance industry, we are constantly judging,
        evaluating, & analyzing our every move, so it was
        nice to sit down to talk about these everyday things
        that affect us and our mental health."
